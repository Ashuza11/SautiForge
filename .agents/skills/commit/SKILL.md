description: Review staged Git changes, summarize them, and propose a conventional emoji commit message before committing. Use when the user invokes $commit or asks Codex to prepare or create a commit from staged changes; never commit without explicit approval of the proposed message.

# Commit staged changes

1. Run `git status` and `git diff --staged`.

2. If nothing is staged, report that and stop. Do not stage files implicitly.

3. Summarize the staged changes in concise, user-facing language.

4. Choose exactly one appropriate type and emoji:

   - ✨ `feat:` new feature
   - 🐛 `fix:` bug fix
   - 🔨 `refactor:` refactoring
   - 📝 `docs:` documentation
   - 🎨 `style:` styling or formatting
   - ✅ `test:` tests
   - ⚡ `perf:` performance

5. Propose a message in present tense that explains why the change exists:

   ```text
   <emoji> <type>: <concise description>

   <optional body explaining why>
   ```

6. Ask for confirmation. Do not run `git commit` in the same turn as the proposal.

7. Commit only after the user explicitly approves. Use the approved subject and body exactly unless the user requests an adjustment.

8. Never push changes without a separate, explicit user request.
